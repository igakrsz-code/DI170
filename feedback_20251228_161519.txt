suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding input validation to prevent non-integer inputs in `player_input()`.
- The code could be made more modular by extracting the win condition checking into its own function.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code implements a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game as described in the chapter content, including board display, player input, win condition checking, and tie game detection. It aligns perfectly with the project requirements.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. Function names are descriptive, and the use of comments enhances understanding. Some minor improvements could be made to further clarify the code's logic.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for the Tic Tac Toe game. The game logic is simple and efficient.
- security: The code does not have any obvious security vulnerabilities. Input validation is implemented to prevent invalid input, which is a good practice.
