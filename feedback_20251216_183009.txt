suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 6, the while loop logic is missing. The code only checks the name once, instead of looping until a valid name is provided.
- In Exercise 7, the code directly initializes the list and fruit choice. Instead, it should take user inputs for both.
- In Exercise 8, the code directly initializes the list of toppings. Instead, it should take user inputs and stop when the user enters 'quit'.
- In Exercise 9, in calculating the total cost of tickets, after calculating each ticket 's cost the value should be saved to the variable total cost
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code mostly addresses the problems. Exercise 1-5 and 9 are fully correct. Exercise 6, 7 and 8, are missing crucial parts of the instructions. Instructions 6 asks to run a while loop until the name is correct, instruction 7 asks for the user to input, and instruction 8 asks for user input until 'quit' is entered. For exercise 9, total costs are not added to the total_cost variable.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to understand, with clear variable names and comments.
- performance: The code is efficient and uses appropriate data structures and algorithms for the given tasks.
- security: The code does not handle any user input that could pose a security risk.
