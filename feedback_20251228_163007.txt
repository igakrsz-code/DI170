Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements both challenges as described in the chapter content, including sorting comma-separated words and finding the longest word in a sentence.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear variable names and comments.
- performance: The code demonstrates efficient solutions for both tasks, with linear time complexity for both sorting and finding the longest word.
- security: The code does not involve any external input or operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.
