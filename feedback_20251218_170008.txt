Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements both challenges as described in the chapter content. Challenge 1 correctly creates a dictionary of letter indices, and Challenge 2 correctly determines affordable items and prints them in alphabetical order, or prints 'Nothing' if no items are affordable. It addresses all requirements, including user input, dictionary creation, loops, conditional statements, string manipulation, type conversion, lists, and sorting.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward.
- performance: The code is efficient for the given tasks. It iterates through the word and the items dictionary only once, which is optimal for this problem size.
- security: The code doesn't have any apparent security vulnerabilities. It takes user input, but it doesn't execute any external commands or access sensitive data.
