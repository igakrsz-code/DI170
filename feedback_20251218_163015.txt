suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.
- While the code is functional, using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `base_number` instead of `number` in Challenge 1) could enhance readability.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements both challenges as described in the Chapter Content/Questions. Challenge 1 correctly calculates and outputs a list of multiples, while Challenge 2 effectively removes consecutive duplicate letters from the input string. The code directly addresses all instructions and examples provided.
- readability: The code is generally well-readable, with clear variable names and straightforward logic. However, the absence of comments slightly reduces readability. Adding comments would clarify the purpose of each section.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given tasks. Both challenges use simple loops and operations, making them perform well for typical inputs. No major performance bottlenecks are apparent.
- security: The code uses `input()` to receive user input, which can be vulnerable to injection attacks if not handled carefully. However, since the code only processes the input as strings and numbers, the risk is minimal. Consider using input validation or sanitization techniques for increased security.
