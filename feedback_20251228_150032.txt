suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `row_index` instead of `row`).
- The player switching logic could be simplified using a ternary operator: `current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'`.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements a Tic Tac Toe game, covering all requirements outlined in the instructions, including representing the board, displaying it, handling player input with validation, checking for wins and ties, and managing the game flow. Each step is clearly implemented as described in the problem description.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow, with helpful comments separating the different parts of the game logic. Using more descriptive variable names could further enhance readability.
- performance: The code's performance is sufficient for this type of game. It doesn't involve any complex computations or large datasets, so the execution speed is not a major concern.
- security: The code handles user input by validating the row and column numbers, which reduces the risk of errors or crashes due to invalid input. It doesn't involve any external data sources or network communication, so there are no significant security vulnerabilities.
